/*
server setup

install npm packages

setup simple mvc pattern

implements JWT based authentication system

before we can save user in database, determine if it exists

check if user's email is valid by sending a verification token as a clickable link to user email

for sending email we will use AWS SES, so we need to signup with AWS. Then ...

Once the user click, we take them to our react app and then take the token from the route

that token consists, of user name, email, and password

Once again send that back to the server

this time we can save the user into the database

This completes user registration.
